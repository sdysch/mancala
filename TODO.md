# To do list
## Strategies
- [X] Minimax algorithm:
	- [X] Implement alpha/beta pruning (for no crazy runtimes)
- [ ] Reinforecment learning
	- [ ] Check out keras-rl and gym environment

## TODO
- [X] Move mancala "rules" into Board class
- [X] New rule implementation
- [X] Max moves agent
- [X] max goal (random fall back)
- [X] Completely rewrite make_player_turn - it is buggy (player switching is just plain wrong)
- [X] Minimax
- [X] Multiprocessing
- [ ] Loop over different marble and cups


## Investigations
- [ ] Win/lose/draw rate vs n_marbles (too expensive for different strategies?)
